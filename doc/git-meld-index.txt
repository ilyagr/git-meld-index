git-meld-index(1)
=================

NAME
----
git-meld-index - Stage changes using common diff tools

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git meld-index'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
'git meld-index' is a Git command that allows you to interactively
stage changes to the git index (also known as the git staging area)
using any git difftool (such as meld).

When you run the command you'll see meld (or your configured git
difftool) pop up with:

LEFT: temporary directory contining files copied from your working
tree

RIGHT: temporary directory with the contents of the index. This also
includes files that are not yet in the index but are modified or
untracked in the working copy -- in this case you'll see the file
contents from HEAD.

Edit the index (right hand side) until happy. Remember to save when
needed.

When you're done, close meld, and git-meld-index will update the index
to match the contents of the temporary directory on the right hand
side of meld that you just edited.

At present changes to the left hand side (working copy) are discarded.

OPTIONS
-------
-t <tool>::
--tool=<tool>::
	Use the diff tool specified by <tool>.  Valid values include
	emerge, kompare, meld, and vimdiff. Run `git difftool --tool-help`
	for the list of valid <tool> settings.

--tool-help::
	Print a list of diff tools that may be used with `--tool`.

-x <command>::

	Specify a custom command for viewing diffs.
	'git-meld-index' ignores the configured defaults and runs

-g::
--gui::
	When 'git-difftool' is invoked with the `-g` or `--gui` option
	the default diff tool will be read from the configured
	`diff.guitool` variable instead of `diff.tool`.
